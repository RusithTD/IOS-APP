# GeoQuiz

A small SwiftUI game where you guess world cities and famous locations from a map.

## Requirements

- Xcode 16 (or recent Xcode that supports SwiftUI + MapKit on iOS 18+)
- iOS simulator or a physical iOS device

## Opening the project

1. In Finder, open the `GeoQuiz` folder.
2. Double‑click `GeoQuiz.xcodeproj` to open it in Xcode.

## Running the app

1. In Xcode, select the `GeoQuiz` scheme from the scheme picker at the top.
2. Choose a target device (e.g. **iPhone 16** simulator or a connected device).
3. Press **Cmd+R** (or click the ▶ Run button).
4. Xcode will build the app and launch it on the selected device.

## Gameplay

- On the **Home** screen:
  - Tap **Start Game** to choose a difficulty.
  - Tap **High Scores** to see the best scores per level.
- On the **Level Select** screen, pick **Easy**, **Medium**, or **Hard**.
- In the quiz:
  - A map is shown with a pin; choose the correct location from four options.
  - The header shows your **score** and remaining **time**.
  - Tap **Show Hint** to reveal a location hint (optional).
  - The timer ticks down; the game ends when time runs out or you answer incorrectly on harder questions.
- When the game ends, you see either **Game Over** or **Congratulations** with your score and best score.

## Sounds

The app uses short sound effects for:

- Timer tick
- Game over
- Success / congratulations

To enable these sounds, add audio files to the `GeoQuiz` target (in Xcode):

1. Drag your sound files into the `GeoQuiz` group in the Xcode Project Navigator.
2. Ensure **"Add to targets"** includes **GeoQuiz**.
3. Use these filenames (any of `.wav` or `.mp3`):
   - `tick`
   - `gameover`
   - `success`

## Hints and AI extension point

Hints are generated by `AIHintService`:

- For many locations, a short fact about the place is shown.
- Otherwise, a compact fallback hint gives the first letter of the correct answer.
- This service is written so you can later replace the implementation with a real AI API (e.g. by calling a web service) without changing the views.

## Project structure (main pieces)

- `ContentView.swift`
  - `GameLevel`, `GeoQuestion`, `QuestionBank`
  - `QuizViewModel` – shared game state and logic
  - `ContentView` – home screen
  - `LevelSelectView` – level picker
  - `QuizView` – main quiz UI and timer
- `HighScoresView.swift` – shows best score per level.
- `GameOverView.swift` / `CongratulationsView.swift` – end-of-game screens.
- `SoundManager.swift` – plays timer and end-of-game sounds.
- `AIHintService.swift` – generates hint text for each question.

## Notes

- Correct answers are not always the first option. The options for each question are shuffled at runtime, and the correct index is updated automatically.
- High scores are stored per difficulty level using `UserDefaults`.
